## REFERRALS

- PEDIATRIC GASTROENTEROLOGIST: Given the patient's recent episode of vomiting and stomach pain, it would be beneficial to have a pediatric gastroenterologist evaluate the patient. They can assess for any underlying gastrointestinal issues that may have contributed to this episode. The specialist should be informed about the patient's recent bout of gastroenteritis, known food allergies, and the absence of other symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, or lethargy.

## LABS & TESTS

- COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC): This test can help identify any signs of infection or inflammation that could be causing the vomiting. It can also help rule out anemia or other blood-related conditions.
- STOOL CULTURE: Given the recent episode of gastroenteritis, a stool culture can help identify any lingering or new bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections that could be causing the vomiting.
- ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: This imaging test can help visualize the patient's abdominal organs and identify any abnormalities such as inflammation, blockages, or other structural issues that could be causing the vomiting.
- FOOD ALLERGY TESTING: Although the patient has known food allergies and there was no known exposure prior to the vomiting episode, it may be beneficial to conduct a food allergy test to rule out any new or unidentified food allergies.
