## SENSES

SIGHT: Look for signs of dehydration such as dry lips, sunken eyes, or decreased tears when crying. Also, observe the patient's general behavior and activity level. These signs could indicate if the vomiting episode has led to significant fluid loss.

SOUND: Listen to the patient's speech. If it is slurred or slower than usual, it could indicate dehydration or other neurological issues.

TOUCH: Palpate the abdomen for any tenderness, distension, or masses. This could help identify any underlying gastrointestinal issues that may have caused the vomiting episode.

SMELL: Pay attention to the patient's breath. An unusual smell could indicate metabolic disorders such as diabetic ketoacidosis, although this is less likely given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms.

## EXAMINATION

- GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Assess the patient's general appearance, vital signs, and hydration status. This can provide clues about the severity of the vomiting episode and whether it has led to dehydration.
- ABDOMINAL EXAMINATION: Palpate and auscultate the abdomen to check for any tenderness, distension, masses, or abnormal bowel sounds. This could help identify any gastrointestinal issues.
- NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Assess the patient's level of consciousness, speech, and coordination. This can help rule out neurological causes of vomiting such as increased intracranial pressure.
