INTAKE: Hello Cyril, how can I assist you today? Are you feeling unwell?

PATIENT: My little boy Daniel (4 year old) threw up yesterday after dinner. He complained about his tummy hurting for 10-15min. Then threw up a lot. He seems better now.

INTAKE: I'm sorry to hear that Daniel was unwell. Can you tell me more about the nature of his vomit? Was it just food or did you notice anything unusual like blood or a strange color?

PATIENT: It was yellowish. Not a lot of food.
