## TOP PRIORITIES
- Recommendation 1: Increase your emergency fund to $6,000 to cover 6 months of expenses. This will help provide a safety net and peace of mind. You can achieve this by saving a portion of your income each month. For example, if you save $200 per month, you will reach this goal in 20 months.

- Recommendation 2: Pay off your credit card debt ($1,000 balance) as soon as possible to reduce costly interest payments. You can do this by allocating a portion of your income towards this debt each month. For example, if you pay $100 per month, you will be debt-free in 10 months.

## ADDITIONAL ACTIONS
- Recommendation 3: After paying off your credit card debt, start making extra payments towards your student loans. This will help you pay off your loans faster and save on interest payments.

- Recommendation 4: Consider finding ways to increase your income, such as taking on a part-time job or freelancing. This will help you achieve your financial goals faster.

- Recommendation 5: Review your expenses and identify areas where you can cut back. For example, you might be able to save money on food by cooking at home more often or shopping at discount grocery stores.
